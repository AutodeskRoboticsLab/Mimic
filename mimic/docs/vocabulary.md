### Vocabulary

This section is intended to clarify some of the vocabulary used throughout this
repository and should be updated as necessary.


### Keywords, definitions, abbreviations

- Forward Kinematics (FK):
  Refers to the use of axis angles to compute the position of the end-effector

- Inverse Kinematics (IK):
  Refers to the use of kinematic equations (i.e. "IK solver"), to determine the
  axis angles of a robot, given the position of the robot's end-effector in
  relation to its base frame.

- Tool Center Point (TCP):
  Refers to the point in relation to which all robot positioning is defined.
  If the tool on the end of the robot is a marker, for instance, the TCP would
  be defined as the tip of the marker.
